<!--  in html every variable contains an element -->
<!-- syntax comopter language specific to each type  -->

<!-- in html '< >' is how you start an element </ > to close' -->
<!-- H1 -H4 will change the size of the font lower the number the smaller the font -->
<!-- same with all other p tags  -->
<!-- inside the <head> tag change whats inside the <title> tag to have it display a name at the top of the browser -->
<!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language  and is use for displaying words on a webpage. it is the the body of the website. Required to run a website-->
<!--  CSS stands for Casecade Style Sheet use to edit colors fonts, font size anything visual -->
<!--  JS stands for JavaScript. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH JAVA they are 10000 percent different -->
<!--  JS is used to add functionality to your website. like when you click a button and you want it to do something or when you click a drop down menu and click enter to submit something is all done using JS -->
<!-- in HTML the most common tag you will use is the <div>  it stands for divide. like you want to divide each tag so that its not all on the same line or in the same section of the website -->
<!-- the problen with that is after the declaring the first <div> tag if you want to edit that specific <div> then you need to give it an ID or a class to reference that specific <div>  or the computer will edit ALL of the divs -->
<!-- other types or tags are <p> <h1> <div> <select> <ul> <li> <button> <input> -->
<!-- when addinfg CSS you place the tag inside of the <head> tag, you can also create a <style> tag but it slows the load time of the broswer when making larger data sites-->
<!-- same with the JS src if your able to run multiple files, JS can be inserted in HTML using the <script> tag but slows the loading time in large data files -->
<!-- structure matters when coding you have to write code the order you want it displayed/ran/executed from top to bottom -->
<!-- some code is read backwards from right to left especiallly when giving an element functionality -->


<!--  when using the = sign 1 = is refered to as the assigner/assignment == or 2 equals will check it see if it will equal that variable -->
<!--  for instance let number = 4      you are saying to tge computer that when ever it reads the word number  it will replace it with the number 4 -->
<!--  if you wanted to check the actual number value of the variable number you would have to say number == 4 -->


<!--  FOR DROP DOWN MENU -->
<!-- when using the <select> tag in between the opening and closing </select> you create your <option> -->
